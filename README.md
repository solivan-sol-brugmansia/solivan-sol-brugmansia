<summary>GENERAL INFO ABOUT ME</summary>
 
  - If you're here because I'm cosplaying someone from The Kid At The Back and you like the game, do not interact, or just sign my ata and be done with it. Do not try hanging out with me.
    - It's not personal beef with anyone, I just do not trust the fandom to not defend or justify Sol's actions. I like Sol's character & design, but I absolutely hate his actions.
  - I am mentally unwell, so interact with care !! I'm not a mean person, and do enjoy interacting with others. I also have autism, so please be patient and use tone tags.
  - Do not try to change my mind on things that I don't like. I've had people get upset at me for not liking Bakugo. I have my reasons, leave it be.
  - If you're a friend, please try to speak with me every now and then. I forget to hang out often, and would rather someone initiate conversation + hanging out.
  - I am an energetic person ! I kin Emu Otori, Haru Urara, Hu Tao, Furina, and Yoisaki Kanade if that'll help you understand my personality more !
